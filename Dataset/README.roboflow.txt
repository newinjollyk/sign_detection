The dataset includes 8467 images.
Signs are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via histogram equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 4.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.64 percent of pixels
